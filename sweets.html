<div>
<h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
<h4>Olive Oil Cake:</h4>
<ul>
<li>1 3/4 cup all purpose flour</li>
<li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
<li>1/2 tsp fine sea salt</li>
<li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted</li>
<li>3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil</li>
<li>1/4 cup whole milk</li>
<li>4 large eggs, room temperature</li>
<li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>zest of half lemon</li>
<li>fresh berries, as needed</li>
</ul>

<h4>Swiss Buttercream:</h4>
<ul>
<li>6 large egg whites (about 1 cup)</li>
<li>1 1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
<li>1 pound (2 cups) unsalted butter, cut into tablespoons, softened</li>
<li>pinch of salt</li>
</ul>

<h3>DIRECTIONS:</h3>
<h4>Olive Oil Cake:</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Line 2- 6" cake plans and 1- 4" cake pan with parchment paper.  Lightly grease with butter.  Set aside. Alternatively, use 2-8" cake pans.</li>
	<li>Sift together flour, baking powder and salt.  Set aside.</li>
	<li>In a small bowl, whisk together melted butter, olive oil, and milk.  Set aside.
</li>
	<li>n the bowl of stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment, beat eggs, sugar, and lemon zest until mixture is pale in color and slightly thickened (about 2 minute).  Scrape down the bowl as necessary to ensure thorough mixing.</li>
	<li>Alternate adding the flour mixture and wet mixture, beginning and ending with the flour mixture.  Mix on low speed until combined.</li>
	<li>Divide batter between prepared cake pans.  Level batter using a spoon or mini offset spatula.  Bake for 30-35 minutes until cakes are golden brown, and toothpick inserted in center of cake comes out clean.  Let cool in pan for 5-10 minutes before unmolding.  Allow to cool to room temperature on a wire rack.
</li>
</ol>

<h4>Swiss Buttercream:</h4>
<ol>
<li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together egg whites and sugar.  Place over a double boiler and continue to whisk until the temperature of the mixture is 120 degrees F.  Alternatively, if you don’t have a thermometer, heat the mixture until all the sugar has melted.  You can test this by dipping your pointer finger into the warm mixture and rubbing it together with your thumb.  The mixture should be smooth.  You should not be able to feel the granules of sugar.</li>
<li>Return bowl to stand mixer.  With a whisk or paddle attachment, beat mixture at medium-high speed until it cools to a little warmer than room temperature.  Reduce speed to medium and add butter one tablespoon at a time.</li>
<li>Once all the butter is in, increase speed to medium-high and continue to beat until buttercream is light and fluffy.</li>

<p>The best light fluffy quinoa pancakes! So easy—just 6 ingredients and made in the blender. If you've never tried quinoa flour, start with this breakfast!</p>
<h3>INIGREDIANTS</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1/2 cup (130g) unsweetened applesauce</li>
	<li>1/2 cup (120g) non-dairy milk</li>
	<li>1 tbsp lemon juice</li>
	<li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
	<li>2 tbsp maple syrup (optional)</li>
	<li>1 1/2 cup (185g) quinoa flour (see notes for making your own)</li>
</ul>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>INSTRUCTIONS</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Add all the ingredients to a blender. </li>
		<li>Blend on low until combine, stopping to stir as necessary. Don't over-blend.</li>
		<li>Heat a non-stick pan over medium heat (I recommend spraying it lightly just to make sure they don't stick). </li>
		<li>Drop about 1/4 cup of batter into the pan and spread into a circle.</li>
		<li>Cook for 2-3 minutes over medium heat or until you can easily slide a spatula underneath. Flip and cook for 2-3 minutes on the second side. Remove from the pan.</li>
		<li>Repeat until all the batter is used up. I got about 8 medium sized pancakes.
		</li>
		<li>Add toppings of choice (fruit, nuts, seeds, chocolate chips, nut butter, maple syrup, etc.) and enjoy!
</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>RECIPE NOTES</h4>
	<p>To make your own quinoa flour, either grind quinoa flakes in a high speed blender or toast and grind whole raw quinoa.</p>

	<h3>DARK CHOCOLATE ALMOND JOY TRUFFLES</h3>
<div>
<img src="https://www.thelittleepicurean.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/almond-joy-truffles-1.jpg">
</div>
<div>
<h4>INGREDIENTS</h4>
<ul>
	<li>1 1/2 cups unsweetened shredded coconut</li>
	<li>5 Tablespoons sweetened condensed milk, or more according to sweetness preference</li>
	<li>12 roasted almonds</li>
	<li>10 oz dark chocolate, finely chopped*</li>
</ul>
	<hr>
	<hr>
	<h4>INSTRUCTIONS</h4>
	<ol>
	<li>In a medium bowl, fold together shredded coconut and condensed milk. Place one roasted almond in a #40 scoop (1 1/2 Tbsp cookie scoop) and fill with coconut mixture. Repeat.</li>
	<li>Freeze coconut mounds for 5-10 minutes until firm. Meanwhile, melt chocolate over a double boiler set over gentle heat. Remove from heat. (Alternatively, melt chocolate in the microwave at half powder in 30 second intervals.)</li>
	<li>Using a fork, dip coconut mounds into melted chocolate. Allow any excess chocolate to run off and drain back into chocolate bowl. Place enrobed truffles on parchment (or wax paper) lined sheet tray. If chocolate is in temper, allow to set up at room temperature. If chocolate is out of temper, place in the fridge for chocolate to set up. </li>
	<li>For longer storage, keep truffles in an airtight container in the fridge. </li>
	</ol>
	<br>
	<br>
	<p>
	<h4>RECIPE NOTES</h4>
		Tempered dark chocolate: When melting chocolate, do not let chocolate exceed 118 degrees F. Chocolate should be melted slowly over gentle heat. Melted chocolate should hover between 112-116 degrees F. Tempered chocolate will naturally set up at room temperature. 

Untempered chocolate will result with dull looking chocolate that will likely have white streaks running through it. It will not set up at room temperature and will need the help of the fridge to harden.
