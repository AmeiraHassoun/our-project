<h4>What We Need?</h4>
<h4>ingrediants"</h4>
<p>for the slow</p>
<ul>
	<li>1 small head (2 to 2 1/2 pounds) cabbage (green, red, or a mix)</li>
	<li>2 to 3 large carrots (3 to 3 1/2 cups shredded)</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon salt, optional</li>
	<li>1 1/4 cup coleslaw dressing</li>
</ul>

<p>For mayonnaise dressing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1 cup mayonnaise</li>
	<li>1/4 cup white wine vinegar or cider vinegar</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
	<li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>

<p>For buttermilk dressing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1/2 cup buttermilk</li>
	<li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
	<li>4 cup white wine vinegar or cider vinegar</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
</ul>


<p>For sour cream dressing:</p>
<ul>
	<li>1/2 cup sour cream</li>
	<li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
	<li>1/4 cup white wine vinegar or cider vinegar</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
</ul>

<h3>Equipment</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Chef's knife</li>
	<li>Food processor with a shredding blade, or box grater</li>
	<li>Large mixing bowl
</li>
	<li>Small mixing bowl
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Instructions</h3>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Shred the cabbage:</strong> Cut the cabbage in half and peel off a few of the thin outer layers. Cut each half into quarters, then cut out the tough core in the middle. Slice each quarter crosswise into thin shreds, or run the quarters through a food processor with a shredding blade. Transfer the shredded cabbage to a large mixing bowl.

</li>
	<li><strong>Salt the cabbage — OPTIONAL:</strong> Salting the cabbage helps it stay crisp a little longer if you're making the coleslaw ahead. Transfer the cabbage to colander and toss it with a tablespoon of salt. Let stand on a plate or in the sink for an hour or two. Squeeze as much moisture as you can from the cabbage, then continue making the coleslaw.</li>
	<li><strong>Shred the carrots:</strong> Peel the carrots, then either cut them into very small matchsticks, or shred them using a food processor with a shredding blade or on a box grater. Transfer the shredded cabbage to the mixing bowl with the cabbage.</li>
	<li><strong>Toss the shredded cabbage and carrots together.</strong></li>
	<li><strong>Whisk the dressing:</strong> Whisk together the ingredients for your dressing in a small bowl. Taste and add more salt, sugar, or vinegar to taste.</li>
	<li><strong>Toss the slaw with the dressing:</strong> Pour the dressing over the shredded cabbage and carrots. Toss gently to combine, making sure all the shreds are coated evenly. (If you're making this more than an hour or two ahead of your party, save a little dressing to toss with the salad just before serving.)

</li>
	<li><strong>Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before serving:</strong> Coleslaw has the best texture and flavor the day its made, but it still keeps well for several days in the fridge. If you're making this coleslaw more than a day ahead, don't skip the salting step above. For extra creaminess, drizzle a little reserved dressing over the top of the slaw, or fold an extra spoonful of mayo into the slaw just before serving.</li>

<h3>Ingrediants</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1 medium ciabatta loaf (or 4 thick slices crusty white bread)</li>
	<li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
	<li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts</li>
	<li>1 large cos or romaine lettuce, leaves separated</li>
	<li>1 garlic clove</li>
	<li>2 anchovies from a tin</li>
	<li>medium block parmesan or Grano Padano cheese for grating and shaving (you won't use it all)</li>
</ul>
<h3>Method</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Heat oven to 200C/fan 180C/gas 6. Tear the bread into big, ragged croutons or, if you prefer, cut with a bread knife. Spread over a large baking sheet or tray and sprinkle over 2 tbsp olive oil. Rub the oil into the bread and season with a little salt if you like (sea salt crystals are best for this). Bake for 8-10 mins, turning the croutons a few times during cooking so they brown evenly.</li>
	<li>Rub chicken breasts with remaining oil, season. Place pan over a medium heat for 1 min, until hot, but not smoking. Lay the chicken on the pan (it will sizzle if it’s hot enough) and leave for 4 mins. Turn the chicken, then cook for 4 mins more. Check if it’s cooked by poking the tip of a sharp knife into the thickest part; there should be no sign of pink and juices will run clear.
</li>
	<li>Bash the garlic with the flat of a knife and peel off the skin. Crush with a garlic crusher. Mash the anchovies with a fork against the side of a small bowl. Grate a handful of cheese and mix with the rest of the dressing ingredients. Season to taste. It should be the consistency of yogurt – if yours is thicker, stir in a few tsps water to thin it.
</li>
	<li>Shave the cheese with a peeler. Tear lettuce into large pieces and put in a large bowl. Pull chicken into bite-size strips and scatter half over the leaves, along with half the croutons. Add most of the dressing and toss with your fingers. Scatter the rest of the chicken and croutons, then drizzle with the remaining dressing. Sprinkle the Parmesan on top and serve straight away.</li>
</ul>
