<div>
	<h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
		<li>4 cloves of garlic, minced</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons sugar</li>
		<li>2 whole lemons, one juiced and one sliced</li>
		<li>2 whole oranges, one juiced and one sliced</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoning</li>
		<li>1/2 teaspoon paprika</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon onion powder</li>
		<li>1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes</li>
		<li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper, to taste</li>
		<li>0-12 pieces (about 4 1/2 lbs.) bone-in chicken parts (thighs and legs are best), pat dry</li>
		<li>1 medium onion (any kind), thinly sliced</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon dried thyme, or fresh chopped</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon dried rosemary, or fresh chopped</li>
		<li>Chopped fresh herbs (rosemary, thyme, parsley), for garnish, optional</li>
	</ul>

	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>DIRECTIONS:</h3>
	<p>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

In a small bowl whisk together olive oil, garlic, sugar, lemon juice, orange juice, Italian seasoning, paprika, onion powder, red pepper flakes, and salt and pepper.

Place chicken in a rimmed 13-in. x 9-in. baking dish. Place parts skin side up and spread them out evenly in the pan. Pour olive oil mixture all over chicken, turning pieces to coat all sides. (If you marinated the chicken in this mixture, still add it all in). Arrange slices of lemon, orange and onion around and under the chicken. Sprinkle all over generously with thyme, rosemary, salt and pepper.

Bake uncovered for about 1 hour, or until chicken is cooked and juices run clear. Remove parts to a serving platter and garnish with additional chopped fresh herbs, if desired.

Enjoy!

<h3 style="color:maroon">Grilled Chipotle Lime Cauliflower Steaks</h3>
	<img src="https://atmedia.imgix.net/2069e524caca1b4bfdf43cec736db6b2978996e1?auto=format&q=45&w=600.0&h=800.0&fit=max&cs=strip">
</div>
<div>
<h3>INGREDIENTS:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>2 large heads cauliflower</li>
		<li>1/4 cup olive oil</li>
		<li>2 limes, zested and juiced</li>
		<li>2 cloves garlic, finely grated</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon honey or agave syrup</li>
		<li>2 tablespoons paprika</li>
		<li>1 tablespoon chipotle powder</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
		<li>1/4 cup finely chopped cilantro leaves</li>
		<li>Lime wedges, to serve</li>
	</ul>

	<br>
	<br>
	<br>
	<h3>INSTRUCTIONS:</h3>
	<p>Remove the leaves on each cauliflower head and trim the stem end until you can set the cauliflower flat on the cutting board. Use a large, sharp knife to trim off the sides, then cut the cauliflower into 3 to 4 thick "steaks." Reserve the florets that fall away for another recipe (see Recipe Notes).

Whisk the olive oil with the lime juice in a small bowl. Whisk in the grated garlic and honey or agave syrup. In a separate bowl, mix the lime zest, paprika, chipotle, and salt.

Heat a gas or charcoal grill to medium. Brush one side of each cauliflower steak with the olive oil mixture and sprinkle generously with the chipotle powder mixture. Place the seasoned side down on the hot grill. Brush the tops with the olive oil mixture and season with the chipotle mix.

Cover the grill and cook for 5 to 6 minutes. Remove the lid and carefully flip the cauliflower. Cook covered for an additional 5 minutes or until done to your desired texture.

Sprinkle with chopped cilantro and serve immediately with lime wedges on the side.</p>

	<h3 style="color:maroon">Memphis-Style Dry-Rub BBQ Tofu</h3>
<div>

<div>
	<h3>BBQ Tofu:</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>2 blocks extra-firm tofu (drained and dried)</li>
		<li>4 tablespoons dry rub</li>
		<li>1-2 cups BBQ sauce*</li>
		<li>6-8 slices smoked gouda</li>
		<li>6-8 whole wheat buns</li>
		<li>olive oil</li>
		<li>sea salt and cracked black pepper
(+ foil for grilling method)</li>
		
	</ul>
	<p>Tofu can be tricky to grill because it sticks to the grill. A well-oiled grill plus the dry rub will help keep the tofu intact. Cut each block into 8 equal pieces and lay them flat on a sheet pan. Generously sprinkle the dry rub, salt, and pepper over the tofu slices. Turn slices over and repeat. Turn your gas grill on high; allow it to preheat for 10-15 minutes. (This is imperative. If the grill is not hot, your tofu will stick.) Using a folded paper towel and tongs, oil the grill grates just before placing the tofu on the grill. Place the tofu on the grill and leave it alone for 4 minutes. Turn the tofu using your tongs, and allow it to cook another 4 minutes. Remove tofu from the direct heat and onto the upper rack of your grill, which you have lined with foil. Reduce the heat to medium. Using a basting brush, brush both sides of tofu with BBQ sauce. Add sauce every 10 minutes of so until you are ready to serve.
Assemble the sandwiches by placing two (or three) tofu squares on a bun along with a slice of smoked gouda cheese. Top that with some purple cabbage slaw.</p>

<h3>Smoky BBQ Sauce:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1/2 stick butter</li>
	<li>1 large sweet onion (coarsely chopped)</li>
	<li>6 cloves garlic (smashed)</li>
	<li>1 large dried anaheim pepper (stem & seeds removed)</li>
	<li>4 chipotle peppers</li>
	<li>1 (14.5 oz) can fire-roasted tomatoes</li>
	<li>1/2 cup brown sugar</li>
	<li>1 cup ketchup</li>
	<li>2 ounces of mustard</li>
</ul>
<p>Melt butter in a pot and add the onion. Cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add the garlic and the peppers and cook for a few minutes to marry the flavors. Add the remaining ingredients and stir. Cover and simmer for 20 minutes. Using an immersion blender, blend until mixture is smooth and return the pot to the stovetop. Simmer uncovered for an hour or until the mixture has reduced by 1/4. This will keep for a week in your fridge -- or just freeze it. Make this recipe your own by adding ripe peaches or espresso powder or chocolate to deepen the flavor -- I really never make mine the same way twice.
</p>
<h3>Purple Cabbage Slaw:</h3>
<ul>
	<li>1 head of red cabbage (finely shredded)</li>
	<li>2 carrots (finely shredded)</li>
	<li>3 scallions (chopped)</li>
	<li>1/2 lemon (juiced)</li>
	<li>1/4 cup vegan mayo</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon of olive oil</li>
</ul>
<p>Mix all ingredients together in a large bowl. If you like it a little sour, add more lemon. If you like it sweet, add more honey.
