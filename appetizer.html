	<li>1 clove garlic</li>
	<li>3 tablespoons tahini</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
</ul>
<p>For the Garnish:</p>
<ul>
	<li>2 tablespoons lemon juice</li>

</ul>
<h4>How To Make It</h4>

	<li>Allow to cool for 20 minutes.</li>

	<h4>Ingrediants</h4>
	<ul>
		<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
		<li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
		<li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>How To Make It</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C).</li>
		<li>Separate the onion slices into rings, and set aside. In a small bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder and salt.</li>
		<li>Dip the onion slices into the flour mixture until they are all coated; set aside. Whisk the egg and milk into the flour mixture using a fork. Dip the floured rings into the batter to coat, then place on a wire rack to drain until the batter stops dripping. The wire rack may be placed over a sheet of aluminum foil for easier clean up. Spread the bread crumbs out on a plate or shallow dish. Place rings one at a time into the crumbs, and scoop the crumbs up over the ring to coat. Give it a hard tap as you remove it from the crumbs. The coating should cling very well. Repeat with remaining rings.</li>
		<li>Deep fry the rings a few at a time for 2 to 3 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to paper towels to drain. Season with seasoning salt, and serve.</li>
